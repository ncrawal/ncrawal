About Me
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, there! Iâ€™m @ncrawal, a passionate and experienced web developer with a strong focus on React.js, Next.js, and Express.js. I have been working in the field for the past 3 years and have gained valuable expertise in building dynamic and scalable web applications.

Experience
React.js: I have 3 years of hands-on experience with React.js, the popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. I have worked on a variety of projects, ranging from small single-page applications to large-scale enterprise solutions. I am proficient in using React's component-based architecture, state management (Redux),Toolkit,RxJx, and modern development tools such as Webpack and Babel.

Next.js: Over the course of 1 year, I have also dived into Next.js, a powerful framework built on top of React.js. I have utilized Next.js to develop server-side rendered (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) applications. I am comfortable with its routing system, API routes, and the ability to easily optimize performance through features like automatic code splitting and caching.

Express.js: Additionally, I have 1 year of experience working with Express.js, a flexible and minimalist web application framework for Node.js. I have leveraged Express.js to build robust server-side logic, RESTful APIs, and handle middleware configurations. I am well-versed in handling routes, managing databases (MongoDB, MySQL), and implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms.

Projects
Here are some noteworthy projects I have worked on during my career:

Health Care Platform For Hospital: Developed a full-fledged Health Care platform using React.js/NextJs, Redux, and Toolkit.  implemented user authentication, and provided a seamless Hospital experience.


Task Manager API: Built a RESTful API using Express.js and postgres for managing tasks and user authentication. Implemented token-based authentication and authorization middleware for secure access to the API endpoints.
